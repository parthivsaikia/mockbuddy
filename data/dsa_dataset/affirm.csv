736,736. Parse Lisp Expression,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.
The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))""
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Example 2:
Input: expression = ""(let x 3 x 2 x)""
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Example 3:
Input: expression = ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))""
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

 
Constraints:

1 <= expression.length <= 2000
There are no leading or trailing spaces in expression.
All tokens are separated by a single space in expression.
The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.

","Hash Table,String,Stack,Recursion",Hard,"* If the expression starts with a digit or '-', it's an integer: return it.

* If the expression starts with a letter, it's a variable.  Recall it by checking the current scope in reverse order.

* Otherwise, group the tokens (variables or expressions) within this expression by counting the ""balance"" `bal` of the occurrences of `'('` minus the number of occurrences of `')'`.  When the balance is zero, we have ended a token.  For example, `(add 1 (add 2 3))` should have tokens `'1'` and `'(add 2 3)'`.

* For add and mult expressions, evaluate each token and return the addition or multiplication of them.

* For let expressions, evaluate each expression sequentially and assign it to the variable in the current scope, then return the evaluation of the final expression.","439,726,781","Ternary Expression Parser,Number of Atoms,Basic Calculator IV"
381,381. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed,"RandomizedCollection is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element.
Implement the RandomizedCollection class:

RandomizedCollection() Initializes the empty RandomizedCollection object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average O(1) time complexity.
Note: The test cases are generated such that getRandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the RandomizedCollection.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""RandomizedCollection"", ""insert"", ""insert"", ""insert"", ""getRandom"", ""remove"", ""getRandom""]
[[], [1], [1], [2], [], [1], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, 1]

Explanation
RandomizedCollection randomizedCollection = new RandomizedCollection();
randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return true since the collection does not contain 1.
                                  // Inserts 1 into the collection.
randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return false since the collection contains 1.
                                  // Inserts another 1 into the collection. Collection now contains [1,1].
randomizedCollection.insert(2);   // return true since the collection does not contain 2.
                                  // Inserts 2 into the collection. Collection now contains [1,1,2].
randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should:
                                  // - return 1 with probability 2/3, or
                                  // - return 2 with probability 1/3.
randomizedCollection.remove(1);   // return true since the collection contains 1.
                                  // Removes 1 from the collection. Collection now contains [1,2].

695,695. Max Area of Island,"You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
 
Example 1:
