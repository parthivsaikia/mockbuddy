1223,1223. Dice Roll Simulation,"A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times.
Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: 34
Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 30

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 181

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 5000
rollMax.length == 6
1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15

If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.
Return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is the result of the ith query queries[i].
Note that each letter is counted individually for replacement, so if, for example s[lefti...righti] = ""aaa"", and ki = 2, we can only replace two of the letters. Also, note that no query modifies the initial string s.
 
Example :
Input: s = ""abcda"", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]
Output: [true,false,false,true,true]
Explanation:
queries[0]: substring = ""d"", is palidrome.
queries[1]: substring = ""bc"", is not palidrome.
queries[2]: substring = ""abcd"", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.
queries[3]: substring = ""abcd"", could be changed to ""abba"" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to ""baab"" first rearrange it ""bacd"" then replace ""cd"" with ""ab"".
queries[4]: substring = ""abcda"", could be changed to ""abcba"" which is palidrome.

","String,Stack",Easy,"An interesting property about a valid parenthesis expression is that a sub-expression of a valid expression should also be a valid expression. (Not every sub-expression) e.g.

  { } [ ]                is VALID sub-expression


Can we exploit this recursive structure somehow? What if whenever we encounter a matching pair of parenthesis in the expression, we simply remove it from the expression? This would keep on shortening the expression. e.g.

443,443. String Compression,"Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.
After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
 
Example 1:

Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""2"",""b"",""2"",""c"",""3""]
Explanation: The groups are ""aa"", ""bb"", and ""ccc"". This compresses to ""a2b2c3"".

Example 2:
Input: chars = [""a""]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: [""a""]
Explanation: The only group is ""a"", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2
Output: 37
Explanation: The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [10,-2,-10,-5,20], k = 2
Output: 23
Explanation: The subsequence is [10, -2, -5, 20].

 
Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.
Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.
Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104
ranges.length == n + 1
0 <= ranges[i] <= 100

1338,1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half,"You are given an integer array arr. You can choose a set of integers and remove all the occurrences of these integers in the array.
Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the array are removed.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has a size greater than half of the size of the old array.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.

 
Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 105
arr.length is even.
1 <= arr[i] <= 105

Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.

In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.
Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""aaaabbbbcccc""
Output: ""abccbaabccba""
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = ""abc""
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = ""abccba""
First iteration is done. Now s = ""aabbcc"" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = ""abccbaabc""
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = ""abccbaabccba""

Example 2:
Input: s = ""rat""
Output: ""art""
Explanation: The word ""rat"" becomes ""art"" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
