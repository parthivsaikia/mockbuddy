937,937. Reorder Data in Log Files,"You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.
There are two types of logs:

Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:

The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.
 
Example 1:
Input: logs = [""dig1 8 1 5 1"",""let1 art can"",""dig2 3 6"",""let2 own kit dig"",""let3 art zero""]
Output: [""let1 art can"",""let3 art zero"",""let2 own kit dig"",""dig1 8 1 5 1"",""dig2 3 6""]
Explanation:
The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is ""art can"", ""art zero"", ""own kit dig"".
The digit-logs have a relative order of ""dig1 8 1 5 1"", ""dig2 3 6"".

Example 2:
Input: logs = [""a1 9 2 3 1"",""g1 act car"",""zo4 4 7"",""ab1 off key dog"",""a8 act zoo""]
Output: [""g1 act car"",""a8 act zoo"",""ab1 off key dog"",""a1 9 2 3 1"",""zo4 4 7""]

 
Constraints:

1 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
All the tokens of logs[i] are separated by a single space.
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier and at least one word after the identifier.

The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.
 
Example 1:
Input: paragraph = ""Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."", banned = [""hit""]
Output: ""ball""
Explanation: 
""hit"" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
""ball"" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as ""ball,""), 
and that ""hit"" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

Example 2:
Input: paragraph = ""a."", banned = []
Output: ""a""

 
Constraints:

1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000
paragraph consists of English letters, space ' ', or one of the symbols: ""!?',;."".

138,138. Copy List with Random Pointer,"A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
Return the head of the copied linked list.
The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:

Since a node can be referenced from multiple nodes due to the random pointers, make sure you are not making multiple copies of the same node. You may want to use extra space to keep old node ---> new node mapping to prevent creating multiples copies of same node. We can avoid using extra space for old node ---> new node mapping, by tweaking the original linked list. Simply interweave the nodes of the old and copied list. 
For e.g.

Old List: A --> B --> C --> D
InterWeaved List: A --> A' --> B --> B' --> C --> C' --> D --> D' The interweaving is done using next pointers and we can make use of interweaved structure to get the correct reference nodes for random pointers.","133,1624,1634","Clone Graph,Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer,Clone N-ary Tree"

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""ababcbacadefegdehijhklij""
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is ""ababcbaca"", ""defegde"", ""hijhklij"".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like ""ababcbacadefegde"", ""hijhklij"" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 
Example 1:
Input

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)

460,460. LFU Cache,"Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
Implement the LFUCache class:

LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.
When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

We will allocate rooms to meetings that occur earlier in the day v/s the ones that occur later on, right? If you've figured out that we have to sort the meetings by their start time, the next thing to think about is how do we do the allocation? There are two scenarios possible here for any meeting. Either there is no meeting room available and a new one has to be allocated, or a meeting room has freed up and this meeting can take place there. An important thing to note is that we don't really care which room gets freed up while allocating a room for the current meeting. As long as a room is free, our job is done. We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

If the room we extracted from the top of the min heap isn't free, then no other room is. So, we can save time here and simply allocate a new room.","56,252,452,1184","Merge Intervals,Meeting Rooms,Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons,Car Pooling"

A move consists of merging exactly k consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these k piles.
Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return -1.
 
Example 1:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Example 2:

909,909. Snakes and Ladders,"You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.
You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:

Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].

	
This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.


If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
The game ends when you reach the square n2.

A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.

Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
 
Example 1:

Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.

Example 2:
Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10

C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...

Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbcbcac""
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = ""aa"" + ""bc"" + ""c"", and s2 into s2 = ""dbbc"" + ""a"".
Interleaving the two splits, we get ""aa"" + ""dbbc"" + ""bc"" + ""a"" + ""c"" = ""aadbbcbcac"".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbbaccc""
Output: false
Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.
One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow.

For example, ""H2O"" and ""H2O2"" are possible, but ""H1O2"" is impossible.

Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.

For example, ""H2O2He3Mg4"" is also a formula.

A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.

For example, ""(H2O2)"" and ""(H2O2)3"" are formulas.

Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.
The test cases are generated so that all the values in the output fit in a 32-bit integer.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.
To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.
Return the following:

If version1 < version2, return -1.
If version1 > version2, return 1.
Otherwise, return 0.

 
Example 1:
Input: version1 = ""1.01"", version2 = ""1.001""

Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both ""01"" and ""001"" represent the same integer ""1"".

Example 2:
Input: version1 = ""1.0"", version2 = ""1.0.0""
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as ""0"".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = ""0.1"", version2 = ""1.1""
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is ""0"", while version2's revision 0 is ""1"". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

721,721. Accounts Merge,"Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: accounts = [[""John"",""johnsmith@mail.com"",""john_newyork@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnsmith@mail.com"",""john00@mail.com""],[""Mary"",""mary@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnnybravo@mail.com""]]
Output: [[""John"",""john00@mail.com"",""john_newyork@mail.com"",""johnsmith@mail.com""],[""Mary"",""mary@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnnybravo@mail.com""]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email ""johnsmith@mail.com"".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).
The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.

Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.

289,289. Game of Life,"According to Wikipedia's article: ""The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.""
The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].

The format of the output is as follows:

For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
	
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".


Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
	
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.


The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
	
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].

If you know the answer to this question, can we extend this idea to every sliding window that we come across in the array? Is there a better way to do what we are doing in the above hint? Don't you think there is duplication of calculation being done there? Is there some sort of optimization that we can do to achieve the same result? This approach is merely a modification of the basic approach except that it simply reduces duplication of calculations once done. The third line of thought is also based on this same idea but achieving the result in a different way. We obviously need the window to be sorted for us to be able to find the median.

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

388,388. Longest Absolute File Path,"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.
In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is ""dir/subdir2/file.ext"" of length 20.

Example 2:

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext""
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
""dir/subdir1/file1.ext"" of length 21
""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.

Example 3:
Input: input = ""a""
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named ""a"".

lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]

0 means the cell cannot be walked through.
1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.

In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.
You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).
Starting from the point (0, 0), return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1.
Note: The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
 
Example 1:

Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,4],[7,6,5]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps.

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.
Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0

Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""III""
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""LVIII""
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""MCMXCIV""
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

 
Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 
Example 1:

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

10,10. Regular Expression Matching,"Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes ""aa"".

Example 3:
Input: s = ""ab"", p = "".*""
Output: true
Explanation: "".*"" means ""zero or more (*) of any character (.)"".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
1 <= p.length <= 20

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
 
Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""cbaebabacd"", p = ""abc""
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is ""cba"", which is an anagram of ""abc"".
The substring with start index = 6 is ""bac"", which is an anagram of ""abc"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abab"", p = ""ab""
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is ""ab"", which is an anagram of ""ab"".
The substring with start index = 1 is ""ba"", which is an anagram of ""ab"".
The substring with start index = 2 is ""ab"", which is an anagram of ""ab"".

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

71,71. Simplify Path,"Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.
In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.
The canonical path should have the following format:

The path starts with a single slash '/'.
Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')

Return the simplified canonical path.
 
Example 1:
Input: path = ""/home/""
Output: ""/home""
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

Example 2:
Input: path = ""/../""
Output: ""/""
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

Example 3:
Input: path = ""/home//foo/""

636,636. Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= logs.length <= 500
0 <= function_id < n
0 <= timestamp <= 109
No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.

8,8. String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.

785,785. Is Graph Bipartite?,"There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
Return true if and only if it is bipartite.
 
Example 1:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
 
Constraints:

graph.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= graph[u].length < n
0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
graph[u] does not contain u.
All the values of graph[u] are unique.
If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 25
s consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses '(' and ')'.
There will be at most 20 parentheses in s.

","String,Backtracking,Breadth-First Search",Hard,"Since we don't know which of the brackets can possibly be removed, we try out all the options! We can use recursion to try out all possibilities for the given expression. For each of the brackets, we have 2 options:


 We keep the bracket and add it to the expression that we are building on the fly during recursion.
 OR, we can discard the bracket and move on. The one thing all these valid expressions have in common is that they will all be of the same length i.e. as compared to the original expression, all of these expressions will have the same number of characters removed. 

Can we somehow find the number of misplaced parentheses and use it in our solution? For every left parenthesis, we should have a corresponding right parenthesis. We can make use of two counters which keep track of misplaced left and right parenthesis and in one iteration we can find out these two values. 


0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
( ) ) ) ( ( ( )  
i = 0, left = 1, right = 0
i = 1, left = 0, right = 0

i = 4, left = 1, right = 2
i = 5, left = 2, right = 2
i = 6, left = 3, right = 2
i = 7, left = 2, right = 2


We have 2 misplaced left and 2 misplaced right parentheses. We found out that the exact number of left and right parenthesis that has to be removed to get a valid expression. So, e.g. in a 1000 parentheses string, if there are 2 misplaced left and 2 misplaced right parentheses, after we are done discarding 2 left and 2 right parentheses, we will have only one option per remaining character in the expression i.e. to consider them. We can't discard them.","20,2095","Valid Parentheses,Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced"
715,715. Range Module,"A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Design a data structure to track the ranges represented as half-open intervals and query about them.
A half-open interval [left, right) denotes all the real numbers x where left <= x < right.
Implement the RangeModule class:

RangeModule() Initializes the object of the data structure.
void addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right), tracking every real number in that interval. Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval [left, right) that are not already tracked.
boolean queryRange(int left, int right) Returns true if every real number in the interval [left, right) is currently being tracked, and false otherwise.
void removeRange(int left, int right) Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the half-open interval [left, right).

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 
Example 1:

Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

Example 2:
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].

310,310. Minimum Height Trees,"A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

Example 2:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]

Input: board = [[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""O"",""O"",""X""],[""X"",""X"",""O"",""X""],[""X"",""O"",""X"",""X""]]
Output: [[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""O"",""X"",""X""]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

427,427. Construct Quad Tree,"Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.
Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
isLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.
In other words:

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.
Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. You are given a 1-indexed integer array flips where flips[i] indicates that the bit at index i will be flipped in the ith step.
A binary string is prefix-aligned if, after the ith step, all the bits in the inclusive range [1, i] are ones and all the other bits are zeros.
Return the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned during the flipping process.
 
Example 1:

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.

966,966. Vowel Spellchecker,"Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.
For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

	
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""yellow""


Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
	
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yllw"": correct = """" (no match)



In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:

When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some queries, return a list of words answer, where answer[i] is the correct word for query = queries[i].
 
Example 1:
Input: wordlist = [""KiTe"",""kite"",""hare"",""Hare""], queries = [""kite"",""Kite"",""KiTe"",""Hare"",""HARE"",""Hear"",""hear"",""keti"",""keet"",""keto""]

You are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master.guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master.guess(word) returns:

-1 if word is not from words, or
an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.

There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).
For each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

""Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word."" if you called Master.guess more than allowedGuesses times or if you did not call Master.guess with the secret word, or
""You guessed the secret word correctly."" if you called Master.guess with the secret word with the number of calls to Master.guess less than or equal to allowedGuesses.

The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).
 
Example 1:
Input: secret = ""acckzz"", words = [""acckzz"",""ccbazz"",""eiowzz"",""abcczz""], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess(""aaaaaa"") returns -1, because ""aaaaaa"" is not in wordlist.
master.guess(""acckzz"") returns 6, because ""acckzz"" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess(""ccbazz"") returns 3, because ""ccbazz"" has 3 matches.
master.guess(""eiowzz"") returns 2, because ""eiowzz"" has 2 matches.
master.guess(""abcczz"") returns 4, because ""abcczz"" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.

Example 2:
Input: secret = ""hamada"", words = [""hamada"",""khaled""], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation: Since there are two words, you can guess both.

Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
 
Example 1:

Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.

         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]
                   |
[            null, 11, 12, null]

A k-bit flip is choosing a subarray of length k from nums and simultaneously changing every 0 in the subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.
Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array. If it is not possible, return -1.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
 
Example 1:

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:
Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]

Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.

232,232. Implement Queue using Stacks,"Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
Implement the MyQueue class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""MyQueue"", ""push"", ""push"", ""peek"", ""pop"", ""empty""]

Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]

","Array,Math,Enumeration,Number Theory",Medium,"Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible by any number less than n. The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better? As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better? Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12

As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.
Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

} The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n. But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the concept is surprisingly simple.


Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121. ""Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation"" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well? 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off? In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition? It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3? Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.

160,160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
Custom Judge:
The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.
 
Example 1:

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Example 2:

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA < m

0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
1 means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:

Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (n - 1, n - 1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1).
After reaching (n - 1, n - 1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells.
When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell 0.
If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1), then no cherries can be collected.

Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

","Array,Math,Two Pointers",Medium,"The easiest solution would use additional memory and that is perfectly fine. The actual trick comes when trying to solve this problem without using any additional memory. This means you need to use the original array somehow to move the elements around. Now, we can place each element in its original location and shift all the elements around it to adjust as that would be too costly and most likely will time out on larger input arrays. One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example. The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable. We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on cyclic-dependencies between elements.","61,186","Rotate List,Reverse Words in a String II"

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.
Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).
 
Example 1:
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.
Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""
Output: [""e"",""f"",""ccc""]
Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abbaccd""
Output: [""d"",""bb"",""cc""]
Explanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [""d"",""abba"",""cc""] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.

Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in nums.
Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.

Return the maximum binary tree built from nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]
Explanation: The recursive calls are as follow:
- The largest value in [3,2,1,6,0,5] is 6. Left prefix is [3,2,1] and right suffix is [0,5].
    - The largest value in [3,2,1] is 3. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [2,1].
        - Empty array, so no child.
        - The largest value in [2,1] is 2. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [1].
            - Empty array, so no child.
            - Only one element, so child is a node with value 1.
    - The largest value in [0,5] is 5. Left prefix is [0] and right suffix is [].
        - Only one element, so child is a node with value 0.
        - Empty array, so no child.

26,26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

As far as duplicate elements are concerned, what is their positioning in the array when the given array is sorted? Look at the image above for the answer. If we know the position of one of the elements, do we also know the positioning of all the duplicate elements? We need to modify the array in-place and the size of the final array would potentially be smaller than the size of the input array. So, we ought to use a two-pointer approach here. One, that would keep track of the current element in the original array and another one for just the unique elements.

225,225. Implement Stack using Queues,"Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).
Implement the MyStack class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""MyStack"", ""push"", ""push"", ""top"", ""pop"", ""empty""]

Implement the RandomizedCollection class:

RandomizedCollection() Initializes the empty RandomizedCollection object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average O(1) time complexity.
Note: The test cases are generated such that getRandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the RandomizedCollection.

699,699. Falling Squares,"There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.
You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the ith square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.
Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.
 
Example 1:

Input: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]
Output: [2,5,5]
Explanation:
After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.
After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].

Example 2:
Input: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]
Output: [100,100]
Explanation:
After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.
After the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100.
Thus, we return an answer of [100, 100].
Note that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.

393,393. UTF-8 Validation,"Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.
 
Example 1:
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.

Example 2:
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

 
Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 2 * 104
0 <= data[i] <= 255

","Array,Bit Manipulation",Medium,"All you have to do is follow the rules. For a given integer, obtain its binary representation in the string form and work with the rules given in the problem. An integer can either represent the start of a UTF-8 character, or a part of an existing UTF-8 character. There are two separate rules for these two scenarios in the problem. If an integer is a part of an existing UTF-8 character, simply check the 2 most significant bits of in the binary representation string. They should be 10. If the integer represents the start of a UTF-8 character, then the first few bits would be 1 followed by a 0. The number of initial bits (most significant) bits determines the length of the UTF-8 character. 


Note: The array can contain multiple valid UTF-8 characters. String manipulation will work fine here. But, it is too slow. Can we instead use bit manipulation to do the validations instead of string manipulations? We can use bit masking to check how many initial bits are set for a given number. We only need to work with the 8 least significant bits as mentioned in the problem.

mask = 1 << 7
while mask & num:
    n_bytes += 1
    mask = mask >> 1


Can you use bit-masking to perform the second validation as well i.e. checking if the most significant bit is 1 and the second most significant bit a 0? To check if the most significant bit is a 1 and the second most significant bit is a 0, we can make use of the following two masks.


mask1 = 1 << 7
mask2 = 1 << 6

Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.
Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
 
Example 1:
 
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.
If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.
Notice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.


Example 2:
Input: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]
Output: [[1,0]]
Explanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.
The resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).
The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:

MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

At the top level, we have ""com"", at the next level, we have ""leetcode.com"" and at the lowest level, ""discuss.leetcode.com"". When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.
A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats ""rep d1.d2.d3"" or ""rep d1.d2"" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

For example, ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: cpdomains = [""9001 discuss.leetcode.com""]
Output: [""9001 leetcode.com"",""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"",""9001 com""]
Explanation: We only have one website domain: ""discuss.leetcode.com"".
As discussed above, the subdomain ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Example 2:
Input: cpdomains = [""900 google.mail.com"", ""50 yahoo.com"", ""1 intel.mail.com"", ""5 wiki.org""]
Output: [""901 mail.com"",""50 yahoo.com"",""900 google.mail.com"",""5 wiki.org"",""5 org"",""1 intel.mail.com"",""951 com""]
Explanation: We will visit ""google.mail.com"" 900 times, ""yahoo.com"" 50 times, ""intel.mail.com"" once and ""wiki.org"" 5 times.
For the subdomains, we will visit ""mail.com"" 900 + 1 = 901 times, ""com"" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and ""org"" 5 times.

You start at the starting point and one move consists of walking one space in one of the four cardinal directions. You cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.
If you walk over a key, you can pick it up and you cannot walk over a lock unless you have its corresponding key.
For some 1 <= k <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first k letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.
Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it is impossible, return -1.

In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.

For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.

Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.

The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.
 
Example 1:
Input: words = [""abc"",""deq"",""mee"",""aqq"",""dkd"",""ccc""], pattern = ""abb""

Explanation: ""mee"" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
""ccc"" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.

We can move all the occurrences of this element to the end of the array. Use two pointers! Yet another direction of thought is to consider the elements to be removed as non-existent.

Image Smoother,"An image smoother is a filter of the size 3 x 3 that can be applied to each cell of an image by rounding down the average of the cell and the eight surrounding cells (i.e., the average of the nine cells in the blue smoother). If one or more of the surrounding cells of a cell is not present, we do not consider it in the average (i.e., the average of the four cells in the red smoother).

Given an m x n integer matrix img representing the grayscale of an image, return the image after applying the smoother on each cell of it.

The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.
Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:
Input: deadends = [""0201"",""0101"",""0102"",""1212"",""2002""], target = ""0202""
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A sequence of valid moves would be ""0000"" -> ""1000"" -> ""1100"" -> ""1200"" -> ""1201"" -> ""1202"" -> ""0202"".
Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end ""0102"".

Example 2:
Input: deadends = [""8888""], target = ""0009""
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from ""0000"" -> ""0009"".

Example 3:
Input: deadends = [""8887"",""8889"",""8878"",""8898"",""8788"",""8988"",""7888"",""9888""], target = ""8888""

difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
 
Example 1:
Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {

}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Return the corresponding expression that has the maximum value in string format.
Note: your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1000,100,10,2]
Output: ""1000/(100/10/2)""
Explanation: 1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in ""1000/((100/10)/2)"" are redundant since they do not influence the operation priority.
So you should return ""1000/(100/10/2)"".
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5

In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].

Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
 
Example 1:
Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
Output: [2,1,2,1] 
Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. 
Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].  

Example 2:
Input: queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4
Output: [3,1,2,0]

1457,1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree,"Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.
Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

Example 3:
Input: root = [9]
Output: 1

1489,1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree,"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes ai and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 3
0 <= ai < bi < n
1 <= weighti <= 1000
All pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.

Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: path = ""NES""
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

Example 2:

Input: path = ""NESWW""
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
 
Constraints:
