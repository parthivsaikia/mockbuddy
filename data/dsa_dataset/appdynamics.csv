394,394. Decode String,"Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.
The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].
The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""3[a]2[bc]""
Output: ""aaabcbc""

Example 2:
Input: s = ""3[a2[c]]""
Output: ""accaccacc""

Example 3:
Input: s = ""2[abc]3[cd]ef""
Output: ""abcabccdcdcdef""

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 30
s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'.
s is guaranteed to be a valid input.
All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].

200,200. Number of Islands,"Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""1"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],

Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""],

n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

380,380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1),"Implement the RandomizedSet class:

RandomizedSet() Initializes the RandomizedSet object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in average O(1) time complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""RandomizedSet"", ""insert"", ""remove"", ""insert"", ""getRandom"", ""remove"", ""insert"", ""getRandom""]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]

Explanation
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.

 
Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to insert, remove, and getRandom.
There will be at least one element in the data structure when getRandom is called.

124,124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum,"A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

","String,Dynamic Programming",Medium,"How can we reuse a previously computed palindrome to compute a larger palindrome? If “aba” is a palindrome, is “xabax” a palindrome? Similarly is “xabay” a palindrome? Complexity based hint:
If we use brute-force and check whether for every start and end position a substring is a palindrome we have O(n^2) start - end pairs and O(n) palindromic checks. Can we reduce the time for palindromic checks to O(1) by reusing some previous computation.","214,266,336,516,647","Shortest Palindrome,Palindrome Permutation,Palindrome Pairs,Longest Palindromic Subsequence,Palindromic Substrings"
