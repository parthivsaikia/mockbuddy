268,268. Missing Number,"Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

165,165. Compare Version Numbers,"Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.


Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.
To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.
Return the following:

If version1 < version2, return -1.
If version1 > version2, return 1.
Otherwise, return 0.

 
Example 1:
Input: version1 = ""1.01"", version2 = ""1.001""
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both ""01"" and ""001"" represent the same integer ""1"".

Example 2:
Input: version1 = ""1.0"", version2 = ""1.0.0""
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as ""0"".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = ""0.1"", version2 = ""1.1""
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is ""0"", while version2's revision 0 is ""1"". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

 
Constraints:

1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
version1 and version2 only contain digits and '.'.
version1 and version2 are valid version numbers.
All the given revisions in version1 and version2 can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

37,37. Sudoku Solver,"Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

The '.' character indicates empty cells.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[""5"",""3"",""."",""."",""7"",""."",""."",""."","".""],[""6"",""."",""."",""1"",""9"",""5"",""."",""."","".""],[""."",""9"",""8"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""6"","".""],[""8"",""."",""."",""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""3""],[""4"",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""3"",""."",""."",""1""],[""7"",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""."",""."",""."",""6""],[""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""8"","".""],[""."",""."",""."",""4"",""1"",""9"",""."",""."",""5""],[""."",""."",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""."",""7"",""9""]]

Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:



 
Constraints:

board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

21,21. Merge Two Sorted Lists,"You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.
 
Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
