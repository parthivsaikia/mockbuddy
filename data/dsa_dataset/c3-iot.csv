930,930. Binary Subarrays With Sum,"Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= goal <= nums.length

976,976. Largest Perimeter Triangle,"Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.

 
Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 106
