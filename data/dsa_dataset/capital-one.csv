228,228. Summary Ranges,"You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.
A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).
Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.
Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:

""a->b"" if a != b
""a"" if a == b

138,138. Copy List with Random Pointer,"A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
Return the head of the copied linked list.
The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

","Hash Table,Linked List",Medium,"Just iterate the linked list and create copies of the nodes on the go. Since a node can be referenced from multiple nodes due to the random pointers, make sure you are not making multiple copies of the same node. You may want to use extra space to keep old node ---> new node mapping to prevent creating multiples copies of same node. We can avoid using extra space for old node ---> new node mapping, by tweaking the original linked list. Simply interweave the nodes of the old and copied list. 
For e.g.

Old List: A --> B --> C --> D
InterWeaved List: A --> A' --> B --> B' --> C --> C' --> D --> D' The interweaving is done using next pointers and we can make use of interweaved structure to get the correct reference nodes for random pointers.","133,1624,1634","Clone Graph,Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer,Clone N-ary Tree"

","Array,Math,Enumeration,Number Theory",Medium,"Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible by any number less than n. The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better? As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better? Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12

As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.
Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

} The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n. But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the concept is surprisingly simple.


Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121. ""Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation"" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well? 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off? In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition? It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3? Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n). For the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia.
