146,146. LRU Cache,"Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Implement the LRUCache class:

LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""LRUCache"", ""put"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""get"", ""get""]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

 
Constraints:

1 <= capacity <= 3000
0 <= key <= 104
0 <= value <= 105
At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.

529,529. Minesweeper,"Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!
You are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:

'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
'X' represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').
Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[""E"",""E"",""E"",""E"",""E""],[""E"",""E"",""M"",""E"",""E""],[""E"",""E"",""E"",""E"",""E""],[""E"",""E"",""E"",""E"",""E""]], click = [3,0]

board[i][j] is either 'M', 'E', 'B', or a digit from '1' to '8'.

Calculate the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

Implement the NumMatrix class:

NumMatrix(int[][] matrix) Initializes the object with the integer matrix matrix.
int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2) Returns the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

You must design an algorithm where sumRegion works on O(1) time complexity.

695,695. Max Area of Island,"You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:

44,44. Wildcard Matching,"Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""cb"", p = ""?a""
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.

 
Constraints:

0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.
The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].
 
Example 1:

Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

Example 2:
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []

63,63. Unique Paths II,"You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
 
Example 1:

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

m == obstacleGrid.length
n == obstacleGrid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

","Array,Dynamic Programming,Matrix",Medium,"The robot can only move either down or right. Hence any cell in the first row can only be reached from the cell left to it. However, if any cell has an obstacle, you don't let that cell contribute to any path. So, for the first row, the number of ways will simply be 


if obstacleGrid[i][j] is not an obstacle
     obstacleGrid[i,j] = obstacleGrid[i,j - 1] 
else
     obstacleGrid[i,j] = 0


You can do a similar processing for finding out the number of ways of reaching the cells in the first column. For any other cell, we can find out the number of ways of reaching it, by making use of the number of ways of reaching the cell directly above it and the cell to the left of it in the grid. This is because these are the only two directions from which the robot can come to the current cell. Since we are making use of pre-computed values along the iteration, this becomes a dynamic programming problem.


if obstacleGrid[i][j] is not an obstacle
     obstacleGrid[i,j] = obstacleGrid[i,j - 1]  + obstacleGrid[i - 1][j]

394,394. Decode String,"Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.
The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].
The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""3[a]2[bc]""
Output: ""aaabcbc""

Example 2:
Input: s = ""3[a2[c]]""

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
