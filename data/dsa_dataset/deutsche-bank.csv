1,1. Two Sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","Array,Hash Table",Easy,"A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","15,18,167,170,560,653,1083,1798,1830,2116,2133,2320","3Sum,4Sum,Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted,Two Sum III - Data structure design,Subarray Sum Equals K,Two Sum IV - Input is a BST,Two Sum Less Than K,Max Number of K-Sum Pairs,Count Good Meals,Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K,Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array"
76,76. Minimum Window Substring,"Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string """".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""ADOBECODEBANC"", t = ""ABC""
Output: ""BANC""
Explanation: The minimum window substring ""BANC"" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""a"", t = ""a""
Output: ""a""
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""a"", t = ""aa""
Output: """"
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

 
Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

 
Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
","Hash Table,String,Sliding Window",Hard,"Use two pointers to create a window of letters in S, which would have all the characters from T. Since you have to find the minimum window in S which has all the characters from T, you need to expand and contract the window using the two pointers and keep checking the window for all the characters. This approach is also called Sliding Window Approach.



L ------------------------ R , Suppose this is the window that contains all characters of T 
                          
        L----------------- R , this is the contracted window. We found a smaller window that still contains all the characters in T

When the window is no longer valid, start expanding again using the right pointer.","30,209,239,567,632,727","Substring with Concatenation of All Words,Minimum Size Subarray Sum,Sliding Window Maximum,Permutation in String,Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists,Minimum Window Subsequence"
121,121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock,"You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
