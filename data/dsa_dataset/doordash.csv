1359,1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options,"Given n orders, each order consists of a pickup and a delivery service.
Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i). 
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All possible orders: 
(P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: 90

695,695. Max Area of Island,"You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Implement the Twitter class:

Twitter() Initializes your twitter object.
void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) Composes a new tweet with ID tweetId by the user userId. Each call to this function will be made with a unique tweetId.
List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId) Retrieves the 10 most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user themself. Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.
void follow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with ID followerId started following the user with ID followeeId.
void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with ID followerId started unfollowing the user with ID followeeId.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []

+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

 
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.
Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.
The result format is in the following example.

Output:

Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.

528,528. Random Pick with Weight,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.

Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

 
Constraints:

board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

20,20. Valid Parentheses,"Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""()""
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = ""()[]{}""
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = ""(]""
Output: false

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

","String,Stack",Easy,"An interesting property about a valid parenthesis expression is that a sub-expression of a valid expression should also be a valid expression. (Not every sub-expression) e.g.


{ { } [ ] [ [ [ ] ] ] } is VALID expression
          [ [ [ ] ] ]    is VALID sub-expression
  { } [ ]                is VALID sub-expression


Can we exploit this recursive structure somehow? What if whenever we encounter a matching pair of parenthesis in the expression, we simply remove it from the expression? This would keep on shortening the expression. e.g.


{ { ( { } ) } }
      |_|

{ { (      ) } }
    |______|

{ {          } }
  |__________|

{                }

VALID EXPRESSION! The stack data structure can come in handy here in representing this recursive structure of the problem. We can't really process this from the inside out because we don't have an idea about the overall structure. But, the stack can help us process this recursively i.e. from outside to inwards.","22,32,301,1045,2221","Generate Parentheses,Longest Valid Parentheses,Remove Invalid Parentheses,Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions,Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid"
