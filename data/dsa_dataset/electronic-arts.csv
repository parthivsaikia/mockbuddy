42,42. Trapping Rain Water,"Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 
Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

 
Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

49,49. Group Anagrams,"Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 
Example 1:
Input: strs = [""eat"",""tea"",""tan"",""ate"",""nat"",""bat""]
Output: [[""bat""],[""nat"",""tan""],[""ate"",""eat"",""tea""]]
Example 2:
Input: strs = [""""]
Output: [[""""]]
Example 3:
Input: strs = [""a""]
Output: [[""a""]]

 
Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

200,200. Number of Islands,"Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""1"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""0"",""0"",""0""]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""0"",""1"",""1""]
]
Output: 3

 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

206,206. Reverse Linked List,"Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

 
Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

977,977. Squares of a Sorted Array,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

 
Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?","String,Dynamic Programming",Hard,,2115,Number of Unique Good Subsequences
