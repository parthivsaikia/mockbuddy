12,12. Integer to Roman,"Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
 
Example 1:
Input: num = 3
Output: ""III""
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.

Example 2:
Input: num = 58
Output: ""LVIII""
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: num = 1994
Output: ""MCMXCIV""
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999

202,202. Happy Number,"Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1

238,238. Product of Array Except Self,"Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

 
Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

200,200. Number of Islands,"Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""1"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""0"",""0"",""0""]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""0"",""1"",""1""]
]
Output: 3

 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
