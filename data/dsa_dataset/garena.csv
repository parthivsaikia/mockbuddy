46,46. Permutations,"Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 6
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
All the integers of nums are unique.

4,4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays,"Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
 
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

 
Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106

810,810. Chalkboard XOR Game,"You are given an array of integers nums represents the numbers written on a chalkboard.
Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.
Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.
Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. 
If Alice erases 2 first, now nums become [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] < 216
