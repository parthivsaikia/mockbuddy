289,289. Game of Life,"According to Wikipedia's article: ""The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.""
The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Example 2:

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

 
Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.

 
Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

1041,1041. Robot Bounded In Circle,"On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:

The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.

The robot can receive one of three instructions:

""G"": go straight 1 unit.
""L"": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
""R"": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).

The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.
 
Example 1:
Input: instructions = ""GGLLGG""
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.

443,443. String Compression,"Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.
After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
 
Example 1:

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.
Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0

","Array,Matrix,Simulation",Medium,"Well for some problems, the best way really is to come up with some algorithms for simulation. Basically, you need to simulate what the problem asks us to do. We go boundary by boundary and move inwards. That is the essential operation. First row, last column, last row, first column and then we move inwards by 1 and then repeat. That's all, that is all the simulation that we need. Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on i out of [i, j], you'd be shifting in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for j, you'd be shifting in the same row.
Also, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to run the simulation on edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not.","59,921","Spiral Matrix II,Spiral Matrix III"
657,657. Robot Return to Origin,"There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

Return true if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or false otherwise.
Note: The way that the robot is ""facing"" is irrelevant. 'R' will always make the robot move to the right once, 'L' will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.
 
Example 1:
Input: moves = ""UD""
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.

8,8. String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.

460,460. LFU Cache,"Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
Implement the LFUCache class:

LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.
When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

722,722. Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.

For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.

For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
 
Example 1:
Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Example 2:
Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

 
Constraints:

1 <= source.length <= 100
0 <= source[i].length <= 80
source[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.
Every open block comment is eventually closed.
There are no single-quote or double-quote in the input.

","Array,String",Medium,"Carefully parse each line according to the following rules:

* If we start a line comment and we aren't in a block, then we will ignore the rest of the line.

* If we aren't in a block comment (and it wasn't the start of a comment), we will record the character we are at.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:

lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
The skyline should be represented as a list of ""key points"" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

","Array,Math,Two Pointers",Medium,"The easiest solution would use additional memory and that is perfectly fine. The actual trick comes when trying to solve this problem without using any additional memory. This means you need to use the original array somehow to move the elements around. Now, we can place each element in its original location and shift all the elements around it to adjust as that would be too costly and most likely will time out on larger input arrays. One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example. The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable. We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on cyclic-dependencies between elements.","61,186","Rotate List,Reverse Words in a String II"

We will allocate rooms to meetings that occur earlier in the day v/s the ones that occur later on, right? If you've figured out that we have to sort the meetings by their start time, the next thing to think about is how do we do the allocation? There are two scenarios possible here for any meeting. Either there is no meeting room available and a new one has to be allocated, or a meeting room has freed up and this meeting can take place there. An important thing to note is that we don't really care which room gets freed up while allocating a room for the current meeting. As long as a room is free, our job is done. We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

If the room we extracted from the top of the min heap isn't free, then no other room is. So, we can save time here and simply allocate a new room.","56,252,452,1184","Merge Intervals,Meeting Rooms,Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons,Car Pooling"

","String,Stack",Easy,"An interesting property about a valid parenthesis expression is that a sub-expression of a valid expression should also be a valid expression. (Not every sub-expression) e.g.

  { } [ ]                is VALID sub-expression


Can we exploit this recursive structure somehow? What if whenever we encounter a matching pair of parenthesis in the expression, we simply remove it from the expression? This would keep on shortening the expression. e.g.

","Array,Math,Enumeration,Number Theory",Medium,"Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible by any number less than n. The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better? As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better? Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12

As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.
Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121. ""Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation"" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well? 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off? In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition? It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3? Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n). For the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

","Array,Two Pointers,Sorting",Medium,"So, we essentially need to find three numbers x, y, and z such that they add up to the given value. If we fix one of the numbers say x, we are left with the two-sum problem at hand! For the two-sum problem, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next numbery which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought for two-sum is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","1,16,18,259","Two Sum,3Sum Closest,4Sum,3Sum Smaller"
160,160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
Custom Judge:
The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.
 
Example 1:

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Example 2:

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA < m
0 <= skipB < n
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
 
Example 1:
