146,146. LRU Cache,"Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Implement the LRUCache class:

LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""LRUCache"", ""put"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""get"", ""get""]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

 
Constraints:

1 <= capacity <= 3000
0 <= key <= 104
0 <= value <= 105
At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.

297,297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree,"Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].

48,48. Rotate Image,"You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
 
Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]

155,155. Min Stack,"Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""MinStack"",""push"",""push"",""push"",""getMin"",""pop"",""top"",""getMin""]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

 
Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

238,238. Product of Array Except Self,"Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

1,1. Two Sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","Array,Hash Table",Easy,"A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","15,18,167,170,560,653,1083,1798,1830,2116,2133,2320","3Sum,4Sum,Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted,Two Sum III - Data structure design,Subarray Sum Equals K,Two Sum IV - Input is a BST,Two Sum Less Than K,Max Number of K-Sum Pairs,Count Good Meals,Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K,Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array"
15,15. 3Sum,"Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

","Array,Two Pointers,Sorting",Medium,"So, we essentially need to find three numbers x, y, and z such that they add up to the given value. If we fix one of the numbers say x, we are left with the two-sum problem at hand!

121,121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock,"You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
