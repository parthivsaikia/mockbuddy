1239,1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters,"You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of arr that has unique characters.
Return the maximum possible length of s.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [""un"",""iq"",""ue""]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- """"
- ""un""
- ""iq""
- ""ue""
- ""uniq"" (""un"" + ""iq"")
- ""ique"" (""iq"" + ""ue"")
Maximum length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [""cha"",""r"",""act"",""ers""]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible longest valid concatenations are ""chaers"" (""cha"" + ""ers"") and ""acters"" (""act"" + ""ers"").

Example 3:
Input: arr = [""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""]
Output: 26
Explanation: The only string in arr has all 26 characters.

 
Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 16
1 <= arr[i].length <= 26
arr[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
