You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 
Example 1:

Example 2:
Input: s = "" 3/2 ""
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: s = "" 3+5 / 2 ""

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
s represents a valid expression.
All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Calculate the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

Implement the NumMatrix class:

NumMatrix(int[][] matrix) Initializes the object with the integer matrix matrix.
int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2) Returns the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

You must design an algorithm where sumRegion works on O(1) time complexity.
 
Example 1:

Input
[""NumMatrix"", ""sumRegion"", ""sumRegion"", ""sumRegion""]
[[[[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]], [2, 1, 4, 3], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 4]]
Output

Explanation
NumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix([[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]);

721,721. Accounts Merge,"Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: accounts = [[""John"",""johnsmith@mail.com"",""john_newyork@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnsmith@mail.com"",""john00@mail.com""],[""Mary"",""mary@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnnybravo@mail.com""]]
Output: [[""John"",""john00@mail.com"",""john_newyork@mail.com"",""johnsmith@mail.com""],[""Mary"",""mary@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnnybravo@mail.com""]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email ""johnsmith@mail.com"".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

218,218. The Skyline Problem,"A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.
The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:

lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
The skyline should be represented as a list of ""key points"" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]
 
Example 1:

Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

Example 2:
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]

Constraints:

1 <= buildings.length <= 104
0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1
1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1

Output: [""""]

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 25
s consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses '(' and ')'.
There will be at most 20 parentheses in s.

","String,Backtracking,Breadth-First Search",Hard,"Since we don't know which of the brackets can possibly be removed, we try out all the options! We can use recursion to try out all possibilities for the given expression. For each of the brackets, we have 2 options:


 We keep the bracket and add it to the expression that we are building on the fly during recursion.
 OR, we can discard the bracket and move on. The one thing all these valid expressions have in common is that they will all be of the same length i.e. as compared to the original expression, all of these expressions will have the same number of characters removed. 

Can we somehow find the number of misplaced parentheses and use it in our solution? For every left parenthesis, we should have a corresponding right parenthesis. We can make use of two counters which keep track of misplaced left and right parenthesis and in one iteration we can find out these two values. 


0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
( ) ) ) ( ( ( )  
i = 0, left = 1, right = 0
i = 1, left = 0, right = 0
i = 2, left = 0, right = 1
i = 3, left = 0, right = 2
i = 4, left = 1, right = 2
i = 5, left = 2, right = 2
i = 6, left = 3, right = 2
i = 7, left = 2, right = 2


We have 2 misplaced left and 2 misplaced right parentheses. We found out that the exact number of left and right parenthesis that has to be removed to get a valid expression. So, e.g. in a 1000 parentheses string, if there are 2 misplaced left and 2 misplaced right parentheses, after we are done discarding 2 left and 2 right parentheses, we will have only one option per remaining character in the expression i.e. to consider them. We can't discard them.","20,2095","Valid Parentheses,Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced"
31,31. Next Permutation,"A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
