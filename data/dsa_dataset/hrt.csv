1323,1323. Maximum 69 Number,"You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.
Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).
 
Example 1:
Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: 
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.
The maximum number is 9969.

Example 2:
Input: num = 9996
Output: 9999
Explanation: Changing the last digit 6 to 9 results in the maximum number.

Example 3:
Input: num = 9999
Output: 9999
Explanation: It is better not to apply any change.

 
Constraints:

1 <= num <= 104
num consists of only 6 and 9 digits.

1317,1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers,"No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.

Example 2:
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 9 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 104

1342,1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero,"Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.
 
Example 1:
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

Example 2:
Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

Example 3:
Input: num = 123
Output: 12

 
Constraints:

0 <= num <= 106
