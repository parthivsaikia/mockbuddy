811,811. Subdomain Visit Count,"A website domain ""discuss.leetcode.com"" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have ""com"", at the next level, we have ""leetcode.com"" and at the lowest level, ""discuss.leetcode.com"". When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.
A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats ""rep d1.d2.d3"" or ""rep d1.d2"" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

For example, ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: cpdomains = [""9001 discuss.leetcode.com""]
Output: [""9001 leetcode.com"",""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"",""9001 com""]
Explanation: We only have one website domain: ""discuss.leetcode.com"".
As discussed above, the subdomain ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Example 2:
Input: cpdomains = [""900 google.mail.com"", ""50 yahoo.com"", ""1 intel.mail.com"", ""5 wiki.org""]
Output: [""901 mail.com"",""50 yahoo.com"",""900 google.mail.com"",""5 wiki.org"",""5 org"",""1 intel.mail.com"",""951 com""]
Explanation: We will visit ""google.mail.com"" 900 times, ""yahoo.com"" 50 times, ""intel.mail.com"" once and ""wiki.org"" 5 times.
For the subdomains, we will visit ""mail.com"" 900 + 1 = 901 times, ""com"" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and ""org"" 5 times.

 
Constraints:

1 <= cpdomain.length <= 100
1 <= cpdomain[i].length <= 100
cpdomain[i] follows either the ""repi d1i.d2i.d3i"" format or the ""repi d1i.d2i"" format.
repi is an integer in the range [1, 104].
d1i, d2i, and d3i consist of lowercase English letters.

770,770. Basic Calculator IV,"Given an expression such as expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"" and an evaluation map such as {""e"": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = [""e""] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as [""-1*a"",""14""]

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].

The format of the output is as follows:

For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
	
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".


Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
	
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.


The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
	
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].



Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"", evalvars = [""e""], evalints = [1]
Output: [""-1*a"",""14""]

Example 2:
Input: expression = ""e - 8 + temperature - pressure"", evalvars = [""e"", ""temperature""], evalints = [1, 12]
Output: [""-1*pressure"",""5""]

68,68. Text Justification,"Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

 
Example 1:
Input: words = [""This"", ""is"", ""an"", ""example"", ""of"", ""text"", ""justification.""], maxWidth = 16

Output:
[
  ""What   must   be"",
  ""acknowledgment  "",
  ""shall be        ""
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is ""shall be    "" instead of ""shall     be"", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

563,563. Binary Tree Tilt,"Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.
The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)

Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)

","Array,Two Pointers,Sorting",Easy,"You can easily solve this problem if you simply think about two elements at a time rather than two arrays. We know that each of the individual arrays is sorted. What we don't know is how they will intertwine. Can we take a local decision and arrive at an optimal solution? If you simply consider one element each at a time from the two arrays and make a decision and proceed accordingly, you will arrive at the optimal solution.","21,1019,1028","Merge Two Sorted Lists,Squares of a Sorted Array,Interval List Intersections"
724,724. Find Pivot Index,"Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

","Array,Prefix Sum",Easy,"We can precompute prefix sums P[i] = nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i-1].
Then for each index, the left sum is P[i], and the right sum is P[P.length - 1] - P[i] - nums[i].","560,2102,2369","Subarray Sum Equals K,Find the Middle Index in Array,Maximum Sum Score of Array"
560,560. Subarray Sum Equals K,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2

453,453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements,"Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.
In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0

 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

985,985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries,"You are given an integer array nums and an array queries where queries[i] = [vali, indexi].
For each query i, first, apply nums[indexi] = nums[indexi] + vali, then print the sum of the even values of nums.
Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
Output: [0]

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= queries.length <= 104
