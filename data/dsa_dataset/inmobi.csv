754,754. Reach a Number,"You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.
You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:

On each move, you can either go left or right.
During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.

Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.
 
Example 1:
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).

Example 2:
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).

 
Constraints:

-109 <= target <= 109
target != 0

","Depth-First Search,Graph,Eulerian Circuit",Hard,"We can think of this problem as the problem of finding an Euler path (a path visiting every edge exactly once) on the following graph: there are $$k^{n-1}$$ nodes with each node having $$k$$ edges.  It turns out this graph always has an Eulerian circuit (path starting where it ends.)

We should visit each node in ""post-order"" so as to not get stuck in the graph prematurely.",,
