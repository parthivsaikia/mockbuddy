204,204. Count Primes,"Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: n = 1
Output: 0

 
Constraints:

0 <= n <= 5 * 106

","Array,Math,Enumeration,Number Theory",Medium,"Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible by any number less than n. The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better? As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better? Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12

As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.
Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

public int countPrimes(int n) {
   int count = 0;
   for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if (isPrime(i)) count++;
   }
   return count;
}

private boolean isPrime(int num) {
   if (num <= 1) return false;
   // Loop's ending condition is i * i <= num instead of i <= sqrt(num)
   // to avoid repeatedly calling an expensive function sqrt().
   for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
      if (num % i == 0) return false;
   }
   return true;
} The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n. But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the concept is surprisingly simple.


Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121. ""Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation"" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well? 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off? In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition? It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3? Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n). For the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia.

20,20. Valid Parentheses,"Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""()""
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = ""()[]{}""
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = ""(]""
Output: false

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

","String,Stack",Easy,"An interesting property about a valid parenthesis expression is that a sub-expression of a valid expression should also be a valid expression. (Not every sub-expression) e.g.


{ { } [ ] [ [ [ ] ] ] } is VALID expression
          [ [ [ ] ] ]    is VALID sub-expression
  { } [ ]                is VALID sub-expression


Can we exploit this recursive structure somehow? What if whenever we encounter a matching pair of parenthesis in the expression, we simply remove it from the expression? This would keep on shortening the expression. e.g.


{ { ( { } ) } }
      |_|

{ { (      ) } }
    |______|

{ {          } }
  |__________|

{                }

VALID EXPRESSION! The stack data structure can come in handy here in representing this recursive structure of the problem. We can't really process this from the inside out because we don't have an idea about the overall structure. But, the stack can help us process this recursively i.e. from outside to inwards.","22,32,301,1045,2221","Generate Parentheses,Longest Valid Parentheses,Remove Invalid Parentheses,Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions,Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid"

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","Array,Hash Table",Easy,"A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","15,18,167,170,560,653,1083,1798,1830,2116,2133,2320","3Sum,4Sum,Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted,Two Sum III - Data structure design,Subarray Sum Equals K,Two Sum IV - Input is a BST,Two Sum Less Than K,Max Number of K-Sum Pairs,Count Good Meals,Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K,Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array"
