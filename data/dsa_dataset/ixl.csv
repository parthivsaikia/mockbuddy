166,166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal,"Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.
If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.
If multiple answers are possible, return any of them.
It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than 104 for all the given inputs.
 
Example 1:
Input: numerator = 1, denominator = 2
Output: ""0.5""

Example 2:
Input: numerator = 2, denominator = 1
Output: ""2""

Example 3:
Input: numerator = 4, denominator = 333

945,945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique,"You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.
Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.

691,691. Stickers to Spell Word,"We are given n different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
You would like to spell out the given string target by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
Return the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out target. If the task is impossible, return -1.
Note: In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.
 
Example 1:
Input: stickers = [""with"",""example"",""science""], target = ""thehat""
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can use 2 ""with"" stickers, and 1 ""example"" sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target ""thehat"".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

Example 2:
Input: stickers = [""notice"",""possible""], target = ""basicbasic""
Output: -1
Explanation:
We cannot form the target ""basicbasic"" from cutting letters from the given stickers.

 
Constraints:

1 <= stickers[i].length <= 10
1 <= target.length <= 15

592,592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction,"Given a string expression representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.
The final result should be an irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.
 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""-1/2+1/2""
Output: ""0/1""

Example 2:
Input: expression = ""-1/2+1/2+1/3""
Output: ""1/3""

Example 3:
Input: expression = ""1/3-1/2""
Output: ""-1/6""

 
Constraints:

The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the output.
Each fraction (input and output) has the format ±numerator/denominator. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be omitted.
The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1, 10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
The number of given fractions will be in the range [1, 10].
The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
 
Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]

697,697. Degree of an Array,"Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The degree is 3 because the element 2 is repeated 3 times.
So [2,2,3,1,4,2] is the shortest subarray, therefore returning 6.

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
 
Example 1:
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.

Example 2:
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.

The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:

33,33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array,"There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
