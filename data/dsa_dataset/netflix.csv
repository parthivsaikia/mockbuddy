981,981. Time Based Key-Value Store,"Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.
Implement the TimeMap class:

TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns """".

 
Example 1:
Input
[""TimeMap"", ""set"", ""get"", ""get"", ""set"", ""get"", ""get""]
[[], [""foo"", ""bar"", 1], [""foo"", 1], [""foo"", 3], [""foo"", ""bar2"", 4], [""foo"", 4], [""foo"", 5]]
Output
[null, null, ""bar"", ""bar"", null, ""bar2"", ""bar2""]

Explanation
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set(""foo"", ""bar"", 1);  // store the key ""foo"" and value ""bar"" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get(""foo"", 1);         // return ""bar""
timeMap.get(""foo"", 3);         // return ""bar"", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is ""bar"".
timeMap.set(""foo"", ""bar2"", 4); // store the key ""foo"" and value ""bar2"" along with timestamp = 4.
timeMap.get(""foo"", 4);         // return ""bar2""
timeMap.get(""foo"", 5);         // return ""bar2""

 
Constraints:

1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100
key and value consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
1 <= timestamp <= 107
All the timestamps timestamp of set are strictly increasing.
At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to set and get.

| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.

 
Table: Department

+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.

 
A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.
Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
Employee table:

| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

295,295. Find Median from Data Stream,"The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""MedianFinder"", ""addNum"", ""addNum"", ""findMedian"", ""addNum"", ""findMedian""]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

 
Constraints:

-105 <= num <= 105
There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.
At most 5 * 104 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian.

If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

 
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

155,155. Min Stack,"Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""MinStack"",""push"",""push"",""push"",""getMin"",""pop"",""top"",""getMin""]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

 
Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

88,88. Merge Sorted Array,"You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

 
Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109

 
Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
","Array,Two Pointers,Sorting",Easy,"You can easily solve this problem if you simply think about two elements at a time rather than two arrays. We know that each of the individual arrays is sorted. What we don't know is how they will intertwine. Can we take a local decision and arrive at an optimal solution? If you simply consider one element each at a time from the two arrays and make a decision and proceed accordingly, you will arrive at the optimal solution.","21,1019,1028","Merge Two Sorted Lists,Squares of a Sorted Array,Interval List Intersections"
