150,150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation,"You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.
Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

 
Example 1:
Input: tokens = [""2"",""1"",""+"",""3"",""*""]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:
Input: tokens = [""4"",""13"",""5"",""/"",""+""]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:
Input: tokens = [""10"",""6"",""9"",""3"",""+"",""-11"",""*"",""/"",""*"",""17"",""+"",""5"",""+""]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

 
Constraints:

1 <= tokens.length <= 104
tokens[i] is either an operator: ""+"", ""-"", ""*"", or ""/"", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

289,289. Game of Life,"According to Wikipedia's article: ""The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.""
The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Example 2:

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

 
Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.

 
Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

12,12. Integer to Roman,"Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
 
Example 1:
Input: num = 3
Output: ""III""
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.

Example 2:
Input: num = 58
Output: ""LVIII""
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: num = 1994
Output: ""MCMXCIV""
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999
