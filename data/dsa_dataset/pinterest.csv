811,811. Subdomain Visit Count,"A website domain ""discuss.leetcode.com"" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have ""com"", at the next level, we have ""leetcode.com"" and at the lowest level, ""discuss.leetcode.com"". When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.
A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats ""rep d1.d2.d3"" or ""rep d1.d2"" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

For example, ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: cpdomains = [""9001 discuss.leetcode.com""]
Output: [""9001 leetcode.com"",""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"",""9001 com""]
Explanation: We only have one website domain: ""discuss.leetcode.com"".
As discussed above, the subdomain ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Example 2:
Input: cpdomains = [""900 google.mail.com"", ""50 yahoo.com"", ""1 intel.mail.com"", ""5 wiki.org""]
Output: [""901 mail.com"",""50 yahoo.com"",""900 google.mail.com"",""5 wiki.org"",""5 org"",""1 intel.mail.com"",""951 com""]
Explanation: We will visit ""google.mail.com"" 900 times, ""yahoo.com"" 50 times, ""intel.mail.com"" once and ""wiki.org"" 5 times.
For the subdomains, we will visit ""mail.com"" 900 + 1 = 901 times, ""com"" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and ""org"" 5 times.

 
Constraints:

1 <= cpdomain.length <= 100
1 <= cpdomain[i].length <= 100
cpdomain[i] follows either the ""repi d1i.d2i.d3i"" format or the ""repi d1i.d2i"" format.
repi is an integer in the range [1, 104].
d1i, d2i, and d3i consist of lowercase English letters.

68,68. Text Justification,"Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

 
Example 1:
Input: words = [""This"", ""is"", ""an"", ""example"", ""of"", ""text"", ""justification.""], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   ""This    is    an"",
   ""example  of text"",
   ""justification.  ""
]
Example 2:
Input: words = [""What"",""must"",""be"",""acknowledgment"",""shall"",""be""], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  ""What   must   be"",
  ""acknowledgment  "",
  ""shall be        ""
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is ""shall be    "" instead of ""shall     be"", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
Example 3:
Input: words = [""Science"",""is"",""what"",""we"",""understand"",""well"",""enough"",""to"",""explain"",""to"",""a"",""computer."",""Art"",""is"",""everything"",""else"",""we"",""do""], maxWidth = 20

770,770. Basic Calculator IV,"Given an expression such as expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"" and an evaluation map such as {""e"": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = [""e""] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as [""-1*a"",""14""]

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].

The format of the output is as follows:

For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
	
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".


Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
	
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.


The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
	
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].



Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"", evalvars = [""e""], evalints = [1]

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell (i.e. blue cell).

Given an integer n, return how many distinct phone numbers of length n we can dial.
You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform n - 1 jumps to dial a number of length n. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.
As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1

sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
 
Example 1:
Input: beginWord = ""hit"", endWord = ""cog"", wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log"",""cog""]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is ""hit"" -> ""hot"" -> ""dot"" -> ""dog"" -> cog"", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = ""hit"", endWord = ""cog"", wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log""]

'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".
Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""12""

Explanation: ""12"" could be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = ""226""
Output: 3
Explanation: ""226"" could be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6).

Example 3:
Input: s = ""06""
Output: 0
Explanation: ""06"" cannot be mapped to ""F"" because of the leading zero (""6"" is different from ""06"").
