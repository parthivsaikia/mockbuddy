289,289. Game of Life,"According to Wikipedia's article: ""The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.""
The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Example 2:

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

 
Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.

 
Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

706,706. Design HashMap,"Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.
Implement the MyHashMap class:

MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""MyHashMap"", ""put"", ""put"", ""get"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""remove"", ""get""]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]

 
Constraints:

0 <= key, value <= 106
At most 104 calls will be made to put, get, and remove.

227,227. Basic Calculator II,"Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 
The integer division should truncate toward zero.
You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""3+2*2""
Output: 7
Example 2:
Input: s = "" 3/2 ""
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: s = "" 3+5 / 2 ""
Output: 5

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
s represents a valid expression.
All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

987,987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree,"Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).
The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.
Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
