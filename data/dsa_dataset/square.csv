336,336. Palindrome Pairs,"You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.
A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:

0 <= i, j < words.length,
i != j, and
words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.

Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of words.
You must write an algorithm with O(sum of words[i].length) runtime complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input: words = [""abcd"",""dcba"",""lls"",""s"",""sssll""]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]

969,969. Pancake Sorting,"Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.
In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.
Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

999,999. Available Captures for Rook,"On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is exactly one white rook 'R' and some number of white bishops 'B', black pawns 'p', and empty squares '.'.
When the rook moves, it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, captures a black pawn, or is blocked by a white bishop. A rook is considered attacking a pawn if the rook can capture the pawn on the rook's turn. The number of available captures for the white rook is the number of pawns that the rook is attacking.
Return the number of available captures for the white rook.

91,91. Decode Ways,"A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...
'Z' -> ""26""

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".
Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: ""12"" could be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = ""226""

Explanation: ""226"" could be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6).

Example 3:
Input: s = ""06""
Output: 0
Explanation: ""06"" cannot be mapped to ""F"" because of the leading zero (""6"" is different from ""06"").

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
 
Example 1:
Input: beginWord = ""hit"", endWord = ""cog"", wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log"",""cog""]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is ""hit"" -> ""hot"" -> ""dot"" -> ""dog"" -> cog"", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = ""hit"", endWord = ""cog"", wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log""]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord ""cog"" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

 
Constraints:

165,165. Compare Version Numbers,"Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.


Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.
To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.
Return the following:

If version1 < version2, return -1.
If version1 > version2, return 1.
Otherwise, return 0.

 
Example 1:
Input: version1 = ""1.01"", version2 = ""1.001""
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both ""01"" and ""001"" represent the same integer ""1"".

Example 2:
Input: version1 = ""1.0"", version2 = ""1.0.0""
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as ""0"".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = ""0.1"", version2 = ""1.1""
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is ""0"", while version2's revision 0 is ""1"". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

 
Constraints:

1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
version1 and version2 only contain digits and '.'.
version1 and version2 are valid version numbers.
All the given revisions in version1 and version2 can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

824,824. Goat Latin,"You are given a string sentence that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.
We would like to convert the sentence to ""Goat Latin"" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

If a word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append ""ma"" to the end of the word.

	
For example, the word ""apple"" becomes ""applema"".


If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add ""ma"".
	
For example, the word ""goat"" becomes ""oatgma"".


Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
	
For example, the first word gets ""a"" added to the end, the second word gets ""aa"" added to the end, and so on.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""1"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""0"",""0"",""0""]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""1"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""],
  [""0"",""0"",""0"",""1"",""1""]
]
Output: 3

 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

573,573. Squirrel Simulation,,"Array,Math",Medium,"Will Brute force solution works here? What will be its complexity? Brute force definitely won't work here. Think of some simple solution. Take some example and make some observations. Will order of nuts traversed by squirrel is important or only first nut traversed by squirrel is important? Are there some paths which squirrel have to cover in any case? If yes, what are they? Did you notice only first nut traversed by squirrel matters? Obviously squirrel will choose first nut which will result in minimum distance.",,
699,699. Falling Squares,"There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.
You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the ith square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.
Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.
 
Example 1:

Input: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]
Output: [2,5,5]
Explanation:
After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.
After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].

Example 2:
Input: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]
Output: [100,100]
Explanation:
After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.
After the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100.
Thus, we return an answer of [100, 100].
Note that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.

 
Constraints:

1 <= positions.length <= 1000
1 <= lefti <= 108
1 <= sideLengthi <= 106

","Array,Segment Tree,Ordered Set",Hard,"If positions = [[10, 20], [20, 30]], this is the same as [[1, 2], [2, 3]].  Currently, the values of positions are very large.  Can you generalize this approach so as to make the values in positions manageable?",218,The Skyline Problem
