274,274. H-Index,"Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
 
Example 1:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.
 
Example 1:

Output: [""i"",""love""]
Explanation: ""i"" and ""love"" are the two most frequent words.
Note that ""i"" comes before ""love"" due to a lower alphabetical order.

Example 2:
Input: words = [""the"",""day"",""is"",""sunny"",""the"",""the"",""the"",""sunny"",""is"",""is""], k = 4
Output: [""the"",""is"",""sunny"",""day""]

384,384. Shuffle an Array,"Given an integer array nums, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. All permutations of the array should be equally likely as a result of the shuffling.
Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
int[] reset() Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
int[] shuffle() Returns a random shuffling of the array.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"", ""shuffle"", ""reset"", ""shuffle""]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.shuffle();    // Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result.
                       // Any permutation of [1,2,3] must be equally likely to be returned.
                       // Example: return [3, 1, 2]
solution.reset();      // Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3]. Return [1, 2, 3]
solution.shuffle();    // Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3]. Example: return [1, 3, 2]


 
Constraints:

528,528. Random Pick with Weight,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.

Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]

and so on.

1 <= w[i] <= 105

146,146. LRU Cache,"Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Implement the LRUCache class:

LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}

33,33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array,"There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Follow up:

A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

","Array,Hash Table,Matrix",Medium,"If any cell of the matrix has a zero we can record its row and column number using additional memory.
But if you don't want to use extra memory then you can manipulate the array instead. i.e. simulating exactly what the question says. Setting cell values to zero on the fly while iterating might lead to discrepancies. What if you use some other integer value as your marker?
There is still a better approach for this problem with 0(1) space. We could have used 2 sets to keep a record of rows/columns which need to be set to zero. But for an O(1) space solution, you can use one of the rows and and one of the columns to keep track of this information. We can use the first cell of every row and column as a flag. This flag would determine whether a row or column has been set to zero.","289,2244,2259,2314","Game of Life,Number of Laser Beams in a Bank,Minimum Operations to Remove Adjacent Ones in Matrix,Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips II"
