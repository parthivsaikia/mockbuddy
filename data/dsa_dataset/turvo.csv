1335,1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule,"You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.
You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].
Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 

Example 2:
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.

Example 3:
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
1 <= d <= 10

1534,1534. Count Good Triplets,"Given an array of integers arr, and three integers a, b and c. You need to find the number of good triplets.
A triplet (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]) is good if the following conditions are true:

0 <= i < j < k < arr.length
|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a
|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b
|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c

Where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
Return the number of good triplets.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,0,1,1,9,7], a = 7, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good triplets: [(3,0,1), (3,0,1), (3,1,1), (0,1,1)].

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3], a = 0, b = 0, c = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet satisfies all conditions.

 
Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 100
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
0 <= a, b, c <= 1000
