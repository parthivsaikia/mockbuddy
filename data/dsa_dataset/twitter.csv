341,341. Flatten Nested List Iterator,"You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.
Implement the NestedIterator class:

NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.

Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []

528,528. Random Pick with Weight,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.

Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.

Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...
'Z' -> ""26""

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".
Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""12""
Output: 2
Explanation: ""12"" could be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = ""226""
Output: 3
Explanation: ""226"" could be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6).

Example 3:

Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string startGene to a gene string endGene where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.

For example, ""AACCGGTT"" --> ""AACCGGTA"" is one mutation.

There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank to make it a valid gene string.
Given the two gene strings startGene and endGene and the gene bank bank, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to endGene. If there is no such a mutation, return -1.
Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.

+-------------+-------+
pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.

 
Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).

Explanation: 
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.

Email address:
An email address is:

A name consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, followed by
The '@' symbol, followed by
The domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters with a dot '.' somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).

To mask an email:

The uppercase letters in the name and domain must be converted to lowercase letters.
The middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks ""*****"".

Phone number:
A phone number is formatted as follows:

The phone number contains 10-13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number.
The remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.
Separation characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '} separate the above digits in some way.

To mask a phone number:

Remove all separation characters.
The masked phone number should have the form:
	
""***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 0 digits.
""+*-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 1 digit.
""+**-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 2 digits.
""+***-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 3 digits.


""XXXX"" is the last 4 digits of the local number.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""LeetCode@LeetCode.com""
Output: ""l*****e@leetcode.com""
Explanation: s is an email address.
The name and domain are converted to lowercase, and the middle of the name is replaced by 5 asterisks.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""AB@qq.com""
Output: ""a*****b@qq.com""
Explanation: s is an email address.
The name and domain are converted to lowercase, and the middle of the name is replaced by 5 asterisks.
Note that even though ""ab"" is 2 characters, it still must have 5 asterisks in the middle.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""1(234)567-890""
Output: ""***-***-7890""
Explanation: s is a phone number.
There are 10 digits, so the local number is 10 digits and the country code is 0 digits.
Thus, the resulting masked number is ""***-***-7890"".

 
Constraints:

s is either a valid email or a phone number.
If s is an email:

righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
The skyline should be represented as a list of ""key points"" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]
 
Example 1:

Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

Example 2:
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]

 
Constraints:

1 <= buildings.length <= 104
0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1
1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1
buildings is sorted by lefti in non-decreasing order.

1348,1348. Tweet Counts Per Frequency,"A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller time chunks based on a certain frequency (every minute, hour, or day).
For example, the period [10, 10000] (in seconds) would be partitioned into the following time chunks with these frequencies:

Every minute (60-second chunks): [10,69], [70,129], [130,189], ..., [9970,10000]
Every hour (3600-second chunks): [10,3609], [3610,7209], [7210,10000]
Every day (86400-second chunks): [10,10000]

Notice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period (10000 in the above example).
Design and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.
Implement the TweetCounts class:

TweetCounts() Initializes the TweetCounts object.
void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time) Stores the tweetName at the recorded time (in seconds).
List<Integer> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime) Returns a list of integers representing the number of tweets with tweetName in each time chunk for the given period of time [startTime, endTime] (in seconds) and frequency freq.
	
freq is one of ""minute"", ""hour"", or ""day"" representing a frequency of every minute, hour, or day respectively.

| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

 
Write a solution to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.
The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10

C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.
For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
Implement the Skiplist class:

Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.
bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.
bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.
