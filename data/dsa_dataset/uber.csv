You are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:

'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
'X' represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').
Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

427,427. Construct Quad Tree,"Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.
Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
isLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:

969,969. Pancake Sorting,"Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.
In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.
Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.

Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []
while iterator.hasNext()
    append iterator.next() to the end of res
return res

If res matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.
 
Example 1:
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

Example 2:
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].

 
Constraints:

1 <= nestedList.length <= 500
The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-106, 106].

2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Example 2:

Example 1:

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]

We will allocate rooms to meetings that occur earlier in the day v/s the ones that occur later on, right?

Either there is no meeting room available and a new one has to be allocated, or a meeting room has freed up and this meeting can take place there. An important thing to note is that we don't really care which room gets freed up while allocating a room for the current meeting. As long as a room is free, our job is done. We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

528,528. Random Pick with Weight,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.

Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]

Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:

The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.
Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:
Input: deadends = [""0201"",""0101"",""0102"",""1212"",""2002""], target = ""0202""
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A sequence of valid moves would be ""0000"" -> ""1000"" -> ""1100"" -> ""1200"" -> ""1201"" -> ""1202"" -> ""0202"".
Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end ""0102"".

Example 2:
Input: deadends = [""8888""], target = ""0009""
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from ""0000"" -> ""0009"".

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

381,381. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed,"RandomizedCollection is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element.
Implement the RandomizedCollection class:

RandomizedCollection() Initializes the empty RandomizedCollection object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average O(1) time complexity.
Note: The test cases are generated such that getRandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the RandomizedCollection.

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].
 
Example 1:
Input: beginWord = ""hit"", endWord = ""cog"", wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log"",""cog""]
Output: [[""hit"",""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""cog""],[""hit"",""hot"",""lot"",""log"",""cog""]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
""hit"" -> ""hot"" -> ""dot"" -> ""dog"" -> ""cog""
""hit"" -> ""hot"" -> ""lot"" -> ""log"" -> ""cog""

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = ""hit"", endWord = ""cog"", wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log""]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord ""cog"" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

 OR, we can discard the bracket and move on. The one thing all these valid expressions have in common is that they will all be of the same length i.e. as compared to the original expression, all of these expressions will have the same number of characters removed. 

Can we somehow find the number of misplaced parentheses and use it in our solution? For every left parenthesis, we should have a corresponding right parenthesis. We can make use of two counters which keep track of misplaced left and right parenthesis and in one iteration we can find out these two values.

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]

208,208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree),"A trie (pronounced as ""try"") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
Implement the Trie class:

Trie() Initializes the trie object.
void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Trie"", ""insert"", ""search"", ""search"", ""startsWith"", ""insert"", ""search""]
[[], [""apple""], [""apple""], [""app""], [""app""], [""app""], [""app""]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert(""apple"");
trie.search(""apple"");   // return True
trie.search(""app"");     // return False
trie.startsWith(""app""); // return True
trie.insert(""app"");
trie.search(""app"");     // return True

133,133. Clone Graph,"Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

 
Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 
Example 1:

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

Example 2:

Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

Example 3:
Input: adjList = []

31,31. Next Permutation,"A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

88,88. Merge Sorted Array,"You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

26,26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

 
Constraints:

","Array,Two Pointers",Easy,"In this problem, the key point to focus on is the input array being sorted. As far as duplicate elements are concerned, what is their positioning in the array when the given array is sorted? Look at the image above for the answer. If we know the position of one of the elements, do we also know the positioning of all the duplicate elements? We need to modify the array in-place and the size of the final array would potentially be smaller than the size of the input array. So, we ought to use a two-pointer approach here. One, that would keep track of the current element in the original array and another one for just the unique elements. Essentially, once an element is encountered, you simply need to bypass its duplicates and move on to the next unique element.","27,80","Remove Element,Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II"

591,591. Tag Validator,"Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.
A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

 
Example 1:
Input: code = ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Example 2:
Input: code = ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.

Example 3:
Input: code = ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: false
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.
In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""

Explanation: We have two files:

Essentially, there are two cases of this problem that we need to take care of. Let's look at the figure below to understand those two cases: The first case can be handled by the good old Kadane's algorithm. However, is there a smarter way of going about handling the second case as well?",,

826,826. Most Profit Assigning Work,"You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:

difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
 
Example 1:
Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

636,636. Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= logs.length <= 500
0 <= function_id < n
0 <= timestamp <= 109
No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.

460,460. LFU Cache,"Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
Implement the LFUCache class:

LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.
When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

486,486. Predict the Winner,"You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.
Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.
Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

97,97. Interleaving String,"Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.
An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...

Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbcbcac""
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = ""aa"" + ""bc"" + ""c"", and s2 into s2 = ""dbbc"" + ""a"".
Interleaving the two splits, we get ""aa"" + ""dbbc"" + ""bc"" + ""a"" + ""c"" = ""aadbbcbcac"".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbbaccc""
Output: false
Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

Example 3:
Input: s1 = """", s2 = """", s3 = """"

430,430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List,"You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.
Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.
Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:


Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: There could be empty list in the input.

 
Constraints:

The number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
1 <= Node.val <= 105

 
How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:
We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]
                   |
[            null, 11, 12, null]

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

722,722. Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.

For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.

For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
 
Example 1:
Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Example 2:
Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

 
Constraints:

1 <= source.length <= 100
0 <= source[i].length <= 80
source[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.
Every open block comment is eventually closed.
There are no single-quote or double-quote in the input.

","Array,String",Medium,"Carefully parse each line according to the following rules:

* If we start a block comment and we aren't in a block, then we will skip over the next two characters and change our state to be in a block.

* If we end a block comment and we are in a block, then we will skip over the next two characters and change our state to be *not* in a block.

* If we start a line comment and we aren't in a block, then we will ignore the rest of the line.

* If we aren't in a block comment (and it wasn't the start of a comment), we will record the character we are at.

* At the end of each line, if we aren't in a block, we will record the line.","385,439","Mini Parser,Ternary Expression Parser"

You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:

Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].

	
This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.


If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
The game ends when you reach the square n2.

A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.

Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.

8,8. String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)

The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.

Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Follow up:

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

","Array,Math,Two Pointers",Medium,"The easiest solution would use additional memory and that is perfectly fine. The actual trick comes when trying to solve this problem without using any additional memory. This means you need to use the original array somehow to move the elements around. Now, we can place each element in its original location and shift all the elements around it to adjust as that would be too costly and most likely will time out on larger input arrays. One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example. The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable. We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on cyclic-dependencies between elements.","61,186","Rotate List,Reverse Words in a String II"

You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the ith square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.
Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.
 
Example 1:

After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.
After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
