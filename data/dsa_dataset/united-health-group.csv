Example 1:
Input: day = 31, month = 8, year = 2019
Output: ""Saturday""

Example 2:
Input: day = 18, month = 7, year = 1999
Output: ""Sunday""

Example 3:
Input: day = 15, month = 8, year = 1993
Output: ""Sunday""

 
Constraints:

The given dates are valid dates between the years 1971 and 2100.

","Array,Binary Search,Interactive",Hard,"Based on whether A[i-1] < A[i] < A[i+1], A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1], or A[i-1] > A[i] > A[i+1], we are either at the left side, peak, or right side of the mountain.  We can binary search to find the peak.
After finding the peak, we can binary search two more times to find whether the value occurs on either side of the peak.","882,1766,2205","Peak Index in a Mountain Array,Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array,Find Good Days to Rob the Bank"
1437,1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away,"Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= k <= nums.length
nums[i] is 0 or 1

","String,Dynamic Programming",Hard,"Is dynamic programming suitable for this problem ? If we know the longest palindromic sub-sequence is x and the length of the string is n then, what is the answer to this problem? It is n - x as we need n - x insertions to make the remaining characters also palindrome.",1356,Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome
