1,1. Two Sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","Array,Hash Table",Easy,"A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","15,18,167,170,560,653,1083,1798,1830,2116,2133,2320","3Sum,4Sum,Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted,Two Sum III - Data structure design,Subarray Sum Equals K,Two Sum IV - Input is a BST,Two Sum Less Than K,Max Number of K-Sum Pairs,Count Good Meals,Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K,Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array"
649,649. Dota2 Senate,"In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.
The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.
Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be ""Radiant"" or ""Dire"".
 
Example 1:
Input: senate = ""RD""
Output: ""Radiant""
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Example 2:
Input: senate = ""RDD""
Output: ""Dire""
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

 
Constraints:

n == senate.length
1 <= n <= 104
senate[i] is either 'R' or 'D'.
