1238,1238. Circular Permutation in Binary Representation,"Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :

p[0] = start
p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 2, start = 3
Output: [3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). 
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, start = 2
Output: [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 16
0 <= start < 2 ^ n
