840,840. Magic Squares In Grid,"A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.
Given a row x col grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 ""magic square"" subgrids are there?  (Each subgrid is contiguous).
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:

while this one is not:

In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[8]]

811,811. Subdomain Visit Count,"A website domain ""discuss.leetcode.com"" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have ""com"", at the next level, we have ""leetcode.com"" and at the lowest level, ""discuss.leetcode.com"". When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.
A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats ""rep d1.d2.d3"" or ""rep d1.d2"" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

For example, ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: cpdomains = [""9001 discuss.leetcode.com""]
Output: [""9001 leetcode.com"",""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"",""9001 com""]
Explanation: We only have one website domain: ""discuss.leetcode.com"".
As discussed above, the subdomain ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Example 2:
Input: cpdomains = [""900 google.mail.com"", ""50 yahoo.com"", ""1 intel.mail.com"", ""5 wiki.org""]
Output: [""901 mail.com"",""50 yahoo.com"",""900 google.mail.com"",""5 wiki.org"",""5 org"",""1 intel.mail.com"",""951 com""]
Explanation: We will visit ""google.mail.com"" 900 times, ""yahoo.com"" 50 times, ""intel.mail.com"" once and ""wiki.org"" 5 times.
For the subdomains, we will visit ""mail.com"" 900 + 1 = 901 times, ""com"" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and ""org"" 5 times.

 
Constraints:

1 <= cpdomain.length <= 100
1 <= cpdomain[i].length <= 100
cpdomain[i] follows either the ""repi d1i.d2i.d3i"" format or the ""repi d1i.d2i"" format.
repi is an integer in the range [1, 104].
d1i, d2i, and d3i consist of lowercase English letters.

person_id column contains unique values.
This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.
weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.

 
There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.
Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

443,443. String Compression,"Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.
After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
 
Example 1:
Input: chars = [""a"",""a"",""b"",""b"",""c"",""c"",""c""]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""2"",""b"",""2"",""c"",""3""]
Explanation: The groups are ""aa"", ""bb"", and ""ccc"". This compresses to ""a2b2c3"".

Example 2:
Input: chars = [""a""]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: [""a""]
Explanation: The only group is ""a"", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

Example 3:
Input: chars = [""a"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b""]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""b"",""1"",""2""].
Explanation: The groups are ""a"" and ""bbbbbbbbbbbb"". This compresses to ""ab12"".
