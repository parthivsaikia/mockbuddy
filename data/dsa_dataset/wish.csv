388,388. Longest Absolute File Path,"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.
In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is ""dir/subdir2/file.ext"" of length 20.

Example 2:

Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext""
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
""dir/subdir1/file1.ext"" of length 21
""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.

Example 3:
Input: input = ""a""
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named ""a"".

 
Constraints:

1 <= input.length <= 104
input may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character '\n', a tab character '\t', a dot '.', a space ' ', and digits.
All file and directory names have positive length.

900,900. RLE Iterator,"We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.

For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.

Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.
Implement the RLEIterator class:

RLEIterator(int[] encoded) Initializes the object with the encoded array encoded.
int next(int n) Exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""RLEIterator"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next""]
[[[3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]], [2], [1], [1], [2]]
Output
[null, 8, 8, 5, -1]

Explanation
RLEIterator rLEIterator = new RLEIterator([3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]); // This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].
rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].
rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5. The remaining sequence is now [5].
rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms, returning -1. This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist. Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

 
Constraints:

2 <= encoding.length <= 1000
encoding.length is even.
0 <= encoding[i] <= 109
1 <= n <= 109
At most 1000 calls will be made to next.

528,528. Random Pick with Weight,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

 
Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.

Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]

Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.

42,42. Trapping Rain Water,"Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 
Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

56,56. Merge Intervals,"Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
 
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]

146,146. LRU Cache,"Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Implement the LRUCache class:

LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""LRUCache"", ""put"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""get"", ""get""]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","Array,Hash Table",Easy,"A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","15,18,167,170,560,653,1083,1798,1830,2116,2133,2320","3Sum,4Sum,Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted,Two Sum III - Data structure design,Subarray Sum Equals K,Two Sum IV - Input is a BST,Two Sum Less Than K,Max Number of K-Sum Pairs,Count Good Meals,Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K,Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array"
125,125. Valid Palindrome,"A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""A man, a plan, a canal: Panama""
Output: true
Explanation: ""amanaplanacanalpanama"" is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""race a car""
Output: false
Explanation: ""raceacar"" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: s = "" ""
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string """" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

781,781. Rabbits in Forest,"There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits ""How many rabbits have the same color as you?"" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.
Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
 
Example 1:
Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered ""1"" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered ""2"" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered ""2"" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Example 2:
Input: answers = [10,10,10]
Output: 11
