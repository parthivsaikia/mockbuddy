15,15. 3Sum,"Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

 
Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

","Array,Two Pointers,Sorting",Medium,"So, we essentially need to find three numbers x, y, and z such that they add up to the given value. If we fix one of the numbers say x, we are left with the two-sum problem at hand! For the two-sum problem, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next numbery which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought for two-sum is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","1,16,18,259","Two Sum,3Sum Closest,4Sum,3Sum Smaller"
2,2. Add Two Numbers,"You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 
Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

3,3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters,"Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcabcbb""
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is ""abc"", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""bbbbb""
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is ""b"", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""pwwkew""
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is ""wke"", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, ""pwke"" is a subsequence and not a substring.

 
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

1,1. Two Sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","Array,Hash Table",Easy,"A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster? The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?","15,18,167,170,560,653,1083,1798,1830,2116,2133,2320","3Sum,4Sum,Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted,Two Sum III - Data structure design,Subarray Sum Equals K,Two Sum IV - Input is a BST,Two Sum Less Than K,Max Number of K-Sum Pairs,Count Good Meals,Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K,Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array"
1275,1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game,"Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case the game ends in a draw return ""Draw"". If there are still movements to play return ""Pending"".
You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.
 
Example 1:

Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: ""A""
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.

Example 2:

Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: ""B""
Explanation: B wins.

Example 3:

Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: ""Draw""
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.

 
Constraints:

1 <= moves.length <= 9
moves[i].length == 2
0 <= rowi, coli <= 2
There are no repeated elements on moves.
moves follow the rules of tic tac toe.
