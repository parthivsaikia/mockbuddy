1138,1138. Alphabet Board Path,"On an alphabet board, we start at position (0, 0), corresponding to character board[0][0].
Here, board = [""abcde"", ""fghij"", ""klmno"", ""pqrst"", ""uvwxy"", ""z""], as shown in the diagram below.

We may make the following moves:

'U' moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
'D' moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
'L' moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
'R' moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
'!' adds the character board[r][c] at our current position (r, c) to the answer.

(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)
Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to target in the minimum number of moves.  You may return any path that does so.

Input: target = ""leet""
Output: ""DDR!UURRR!!DDD!""
Example 2:
Input: target = ""code""
Output: ""RR!DDRR!UUL!R!""

 
Constraints:

56,56. Merge Intervals,"Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
 
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

 
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

200,200. Number of Islands,"Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
Example 1:

4,4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays,"Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
 
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

 
Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000

10,10. Regular Expression Matching,"Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes ""aa"".

Example 3:
Input: s = ""ab"", p = "".*""
Output: true
Explanation: "".*"" means ""zero or more (*) of any character (.)"".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
1 <= p.length <= 20
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

33,33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array,"There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
